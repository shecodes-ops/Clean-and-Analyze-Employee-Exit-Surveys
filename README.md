# Clean-and-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys
In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JpyjZ6AyFUAquHzU-7pQgJHhLs5yCH6mxh7uMnRjReY/edit#gid=0) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0zJHim8YLEWmNv4iN4chiOoulqoZNFNNvPa9XI8-DA/edit#gid=0). We've made some slight modifications to these datasets to make them easier to work with, including changing the encoding to UTF-8 (the original ones are encoded using cp1252.)

In this project, we will answer the following questions:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
